Wheels on the bus, wheel, wheels on the bus
Wheels on the bus, wheel, wheels on the bus
Whe-Whe-Wheels on the bus, wheel, wheels on the bus (onii-chan)
Wheels on the bus, yeah (Yeah)

Natsu, why you gotta kill this ish?

It's the ecchi don, siscon veteran, three million plays
I been eating good, y'all look Ramadan from a young age
I been spitting good,
Been fucking better, give you 10 bars like a damn beretta
Give her 6 more just to make her wetter, sweet 16, so obscene
Senpai ain't really bout the club scene,
All these fans wanna see how kami live
Find lil kouhai, bring her to my crib
Slobbed on my knob, swear that bitch need a bib
She want my seed and I got lots to give
Dicking her long feel that shit in her ribs
Licked me up said it's delicious
My sex pistol Sid, Viscous
From the get go, wanna roll with her, Niisan
Aniki all up in her head like a Vulcan
One touch rip her clothes, Ikki tousen
One punch Saitama style, that's abortion
Rap break sound waves, distortion
3D kick her out like an orphan
2D girl I spend more bands
Music in her brain like endorphins
Oh man, LWDGNG be the clique and my clan
Feel like SoundCloud in my hand
Looked at my stats said "god damn"
Shouts Hentai Dude that's my fam
Meltycanon, Moe Shop, Natsu going ham
Put that shit together get that musical grand slam

Shiki on the track, that's a dope hook
Caught me in the bed with your sis, that's a good look
Niggas out here begging me to diss, bro I ain't shook
Ecchi Rap should copyright that, cuz I wrote the book, yeah yeah
Shiki on the track, that's a dope hook
Caught me in the bed with your sis, that's a good look
Niggas out here begging me to diss, bro I ain't shook
Ecchi Rap should copyright that, cuz I wrote the book, yeah yeah

Back up in it the realest descendent
You sense it it's tenchi, the women they love me
Turn ecchi the moment they met me
My style is on par with the stars, I'm aligning them all
A constellation I'm spitting remember they called me a god
Man they feeling it my name had reach the great vine tell a friend
They say "king is here from old times," now they call me Gilgamesh
You would think a goddess nidaba the way I kill this shit
I broke past my limit of sora, now I anu it
Honor this, I am the highest it's told by Sumerians
Broke the barriers my teaching reaching different areas
I invaded the game control your mind like an alien
I have people ask me all the time, "yo where the hell you been?"
I been underground honing my talents
Controlling my malice
Around me maintaining balance
Was chose to drink from the chalice
Women wonder about across the land, call them Alice
Me and Shiki have another classic for the masses

Natsu, why you gotta kill this shit?
